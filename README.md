# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page

![Design preview for the Sunnyside agency landing page coding challenge](desktop-preview.jpg)

## Summary

I enjoyed this one as it seemed to play will with an 'intrinsic design' approach. I feel like I'm getting better and more used to this approach, and I think it's a lovely way to build pages. I only used one breakpoint in this design which is to adjust the alignment of text in some sections.

## Resources

- 🔗 For the burger menu I used [Andy Bell's fully-responsive, progressively enhanced burger menu](https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-fully-responsive-progressively-enhanced-burger-menu/). The link provides a very thorough and in-depth guide to building one.
- 🔗 For many of the utility classes I used guidance from [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev), which is kind of living up to its name. I took my a while to appreciate the approaches it advocates, but am increasingly appreciating them.

## Future learning

- 🙇‍♂️ I'm learning React in the background to all this, so want to concentrate on layout for a few challenges now while I build up some core skills in React and hopefully get to try a project using it before too long.
